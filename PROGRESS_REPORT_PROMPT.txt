Create a brief, human-readable progress report for a Django web application project. Write it in first person ("I have...", "I set up...") and use natural, conversational language. Keep it concise and focused on what has been accomplished, not what the project is about.

Here's what I have done so far:

**Project Setup:**
- Created a Django project called "capstone"
- Configured the project to use MySQL database (laundry_management_system)
- Set up Django REST Framework and JWT authentication
- Installed and configured necessary dependencies

**Database Design:**
- Created a comprehensive SQL file (laundry database.sql) that defines the complete database schema before working on Django models
- The SQL file includes tables for: users, customers, services, orders, order_items, payments, order_status_history, notifications, and inventory_items
- Defined all table attributes, relationships, foreign keys, indexes, constraints, triggers, views, and stored procedures
- This SQL file served as the blueprint for the database structure

**Django Applications Created:**
- accounts app: Custom user authentication system with role-based access (superadmin, admin, employee, client)
- customers app: Customer profile management
- services app: Laundry service catalog management
- orders app: Order management system
- payments app: Payment processing
- dashboard app: Dashboard functionality
- client_portal app: Client-facing portal

**Models Implemented:**
- User model: Custom user model extending AbstractUser with role-based fields
- Customer model: Extended profile for client users with contact information and order statistics
- Service model: Service catalog with pricing, categories, and tracking fields

**Backend Development:**
- Implemented authentication system using JWT tokens
- Created serializers for user management, customer management, and profile updates
- Built views for login, registration, profile management, and user CRUD operations
- Implemented role-based permissions and access control
- Created custom exception handling for authentication errors
- Set up URL routing for all API endpoints

**Frontend Development:**
- Created HTML templates for login, registration, user profiles, and admin interfaces
- Built JavaScript files for form handling, API interactions, and dynamic UI updates
- Implemented client-side authentication token management
- Created responsive forms and user interfaces
- Added error handling and user feedback mechanisms

**Key Features Implemented:**
- User authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control (superadmin, admin, employee, client)
- User profile management with self-update capabilities
- Admin interfaces for managing users, customers, and services
- Password change functionality with strength validation
- Account activation/deactivation handling
- Customer profile management with notes and contact information

Format the report as a simple text document with clear sections. Write it as if I'm explaining my progress to a colleague or supervisor - natural, professional, but not overly formal. Focus on the technical work completed, not the business purpose of the application.
