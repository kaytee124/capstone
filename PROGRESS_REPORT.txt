PROGRESS REPORT - Django Web Application Development

Project Setup
-------------
I started by setting up a new Django project called "capstone" and configured it to work with a MySQL database. I installed Django REST Framework and JWT authentication libraries to handle API requests and secure user authentication. The project structure was organized with separate Django apps for different functionalities.

Database Design
---------------
Before diving into Django models, I created a comprehensive SQL file (laundry database.sql) that defined the entire database schema. This file included all the tables I needed: users, customers, services, orders, order_items, payments, order_status_history, notifications, and inventory_items. I specified all the attributes for each table, set up foreign key relationships, added indexes for performance, created constraints to ensure data integrity, and even included triggers and stored procedures for automated business logic. This SQL file served as my blueprint - I used it as a reference when creating the Django models later.

Django Applications
------------------
I created several Django apps to organize the code:
- accounts: Handles user authentication and management
- customers: Manages customer profiles
- services: Service catalog management
- orders: Order processing system
- payments: Payment handling
- dashboard: Dashboard functionality
- client_portal: Client-facing features

Models Implementation
--------------------
I implemented the core models starting with a custom User model that extends Django's AbstractUser. This model includes role-based fields (superadmin, admin, employee, client) and tracks who updated each user record. I also created a Customer model that stores extended profile information for clients, including contact details, order statistics, and notes. The Service model was set up to manage the laundry service catalog with pricing and category information.

Backend Development
------------------
I built out the authentication system using JWT tokens, allowing users to log in and receive secure access tokens. I created serializers to handle data validation and transformation for user management, customer profiles, and various update operations. The views handle login, registration, profile updates, and admin operations for managing users and customers. I implemented role-based permissions so different user types have appropriate access levels. I also added custom exception handling to provide clear error messages for authentication failures and account issues.

Frontend Development
-------------------
I created HTML templates for the user interface, including login pages, registration forms, user profile displays, and admin management interfaces. I wrote JavaScript files to handle form submissions, communicate with the API endpoints, manage authentication tokens in the browser, and update the user interface dynamically. The forms include validation, error handling, and user feedback so people know when operations succeed or fail.

Current Status
-------------
The authentication system is fully functional with role-based access control. Users can log in, update their profiles, and administrators can manage other users. The customer management system allows tracking customer information with notes and contact details. Password changes are implemented with strength validation. The system properly handles account activation and deactivation, showing appropriate messages to users.
